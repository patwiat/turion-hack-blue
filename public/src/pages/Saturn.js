              Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun and the Solar System's
              second-largest, following Jupiter, is a gas giant with a
              remarkable size, boasting an average radius nearly ten times that
              of Earth. Despite having only one-eighth of Earth's density, it
              remarkably surpasses our planet in mass by over 95 times. Saturn's
              interior is believed to consist of a rocky core, encased by layers
              of metallic hydrogen, liquid hydrogen, liquid helium, and a
              gaseous outer layer. This planet's pale yellow appearance results
              from ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere, and it possesses a
              planetary magnetic field generated by an electrical current within
              the metallic hydrogen layer, which, although weaker than Earth's,
              boasts a magnetic moment 580 times greater due to Saturn's vast
              size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is about one-twentieth that
              of Jupiter. Its outer atmosphere may appear subdued, but it can
              feature long-lasting features, and its winds can reach staggering
              speeds of up to 1,800 kilometers per hour. Saturn is renowned for
              its prominent ring system, predominantly composed of ice
              particles, with some rocky debris and dust. The planet hosts an
              extensive moon system, with at least 146 known moons, 63 of which
              have official names. Titan, the largest moon and the
              second-largest in the Solar System, is even more substantial
              (though less massive) than the planet Mercury and notably boasts a
              substantial atmosphere, making it the only moon in the Solar
              System with this characteristic.
